* Application

A multiplayer online game by hobbyist game developers (e.g. for a Game Jam). The game requires low latency, reliable networking and high network throughput.

The project will compare AWS, GCP and Azure with their free VM offerings accessible to students.

* Specific questions

Is there a significant difference in the free tier offerings of AWS, GCP and Azure in terms of:
 - RTT
 - Network throughput

* Comparisons

To ensure that the comparison is comparing similar devices:
 - The regions of each VM are set to the closest datacentre to London (AWS/GCP - EUW2, Azure - UK South)
 - All devices are running Ubuntu 22.04_LTS

* Measurements

Use IPerf to generate UDP traffic, results will be stored as Json
Use ping to get rtt > plaintext

Collected system metrics are stored by Prometheus

Grafana and [[https://github.com/hchiuzhuo/iperfPlotter][iperfPlotter]] will be used to plot metrics

Statistics testing for significant differences will be done in Python using statsmodels -> can check if there is a real difference
